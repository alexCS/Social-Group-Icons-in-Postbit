To Install:
Add this product as you would any other vBulletin product. 
Admin -> Plugins & Products -> Manage Products -> Add/Import Product

After it is installed, enable it by going to 
Admin -> Settings -> Options -> Redinkdesign - Group Icons in Postbit -> Enable
Select if you want public, invite only and/or moderated icons to show up
To set the default icon for social groups which gets displayed if the group doesn't have an icon, you'll need to set the stylevar "usefilegroupicon". It should be set by default, but you should update it for your specific theme.
